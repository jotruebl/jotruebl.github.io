This is the first post of a series I am writing on Business Analysis. The source
for this content comes from Jeremy Aschenbrenner's Business Analysis
Fundamentals course on Udemy. In this first post, I'll briefly describe the
different types of business analyst roles and provide a concrete example from my own
day-to-day responsibilities as an Environmental Informations Specialist at
Hatfield.

## The Roles of a Business Analyst
### Requirements Analyst

Works with project stakeholders to help determine, analyze, and document the
requirements for the business. They dig out the needs and wants of the
organization for the users which then allows solutions to be crafted. It's possible
for this role to blend in with the Systems Analyst, particularely when they
become involved in the functional design of the solutions. 

### Systems Analyst

Doesn't participate in requirements gathering process. Rather, takes the
pre-determined requirements and works to design and craft a solution. This
process involves collaboration with developers to draft a specifications sheet.

### Data Analyst

Focuses on data, types of data, and relationships among data elements. This can
include documenting the types and structures of the business data model as well
as mining the business data for potential opportunities and risks. They also
create reporting tools to help managers make business decisions.

### User Experience Analyst

Designs the user interface look and interaction. Focus here is on
efficiency and ease of use. A key skill of this role is understanding the
end-user's behavior, as it allows development of intuitive UI. 

### Business Process Analyst

Helps the executives in decision making by modeling and simulating
"what-if" scenarios. Creates figures detailing current process workflows in
order to help identify areas of potential opportunities and risk. Then
creates figures showing future process workflows, which helps executives decide
the best path forward.

## A Concrete Example

It's common for a business analyst to shift between the various roles listed
above based on the needs of the business at any given time. My experience is no
exception to this. My day-to-day responsibilities seem to line up best with the
requirements analyst, systems analyst, and user experience analyst, with less
time focused on business processes and data (that is, *business* data. I
analyze plenty of environmental data at Hatfield).

As an example, I regularly have conversations with my supervisor over the needs
and ultimate goals for Hatfield's environmental data management software.
Sometimes these are off-hand conversations while other times they are planned
brainstorming sessions. I then document the salient ideas from these
conversations into planning documents, which consist of a list of goals/requirements for the
application and projects that we'll work on to achieve those goals over the next
few months. In this way, I perform the duties of a requirements analyst.

Once the list of needs is written, I work on writing spec sheets for each item.
This step actually involves three different roles: systems analyst, data analyst, and user
experience analyst. Essentially my job here is to write a specifications sheet that
outlines the design of a new feature which will be implemented to meet a list of
requirements. This includes the systems analyst role of working with
developers to determine the specifics of the software (e.g., architectural
decisions, API, various code decisions). As a data analyst, I help to design the
data model based on my knowledge of the requirements and domain. 
This model will then be used by the application. Finally, I draft mockups of the UI for the new feature,
based on my understanding of the existing software, the typical behavior of the
users, and the requirements.
